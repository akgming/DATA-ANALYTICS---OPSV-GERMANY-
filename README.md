# DATA-ANALYTICS---OPSV-GERMANY-

data project case studies using the data from OPSV Germany Electricity consumption Data
he DATA SET : Open Power Systems Data
We'll be working with daily time series of Open Power System Data (OPSD) for Germany, which has been rapidly expanding its renewable energy production in recent years. The data set includes country-wide totals of electricity consumption, wind power production, and solar power production for 2006-2017. link for the data click here

The columns of the data file are:
Date --- The date (yyyy-mm-dd format)
Consumption --- Electricity consumption in GWh
Wind --- Wind power production in GWh
Solar --- Solar power production in GWh
Wind+Solar --- Sum of wind and solar power production in GWh
We will explore how electricity consumption and production in Germany
have varied over time :

When is electricity consumption typically highest and lowest?

How do wind and solar power production vary with seasons of the year?

What are the long-term trends in electricity consumption, solar power, and wind power?
